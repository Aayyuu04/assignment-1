Remember to move your clock backward by an hour.)\n\n## Scenario\n\nYou are working as a data scientist in a venture capital investment firm. You have been given some\ndata about a potential company to invest in. You will create some models to predict what the \npotential company will be like in 12 months' time.\n\n\n## About this assignment\n\nThis assessment focuses on fundamental statistical analysis, which\nwill apply linear and logistic regression techniques on one or more\ndata sets.\n\nThe relevant ULO (Unit Learning Outcomes) are:\n\n- Identify the appropriate Data Science analysis for a problem and\n  apply that method to the problem.\n\n- Interpret Data Science analyses and summarise and identify the most\n  important aspects of a Data Science analysis.\n\n- Present the results of their Data Science analyses both verbally and\n  in written form.\n  \nTotal: 15 marks\n  \n\n## Submission\n\nUse https://classroom.github.com/a/BdRkY5OH to create a new empty\nrepository.\n\nComplete this notebook and add it to a new GitHub repository.\n\nSubmit this repository via Github Classroom.\n\nAdd the video that you create (in the last step) to your GitHub repository.\n\nYou don't need to submit your CSV data file, but we won't penalise you\nif you do.\n\n## Use of Generative AI\n\nFeel free to use Gen-AI tools (ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek,\nLlama, etc.) to assist you in writing the code. That's what everyone\nin industry does nowadays. There are some suggested prompts at the bottom\nof this notebook.\n\nRemember that you may be called on to explain what your code does and\nhow it works, so if you have some code generated for you that you\ndon't fully understand, spend some time with your Gen-AI tool asking\nfor clarification until you are confident. Having a personal tutor\nguide you is one of the newest and fastest ways to learn to program in\nPython, so make the most of the opportunity. \n\nTo help you remember what your code does, you can add comments to your\ncode either by creating another markdown cell, or by using \"#\" at the\nbeginning of a line in a code cell.\n\nDon't use Gen-AI tools for writing reflections and observations. You\nwill find many cells in this notebook where you need to enter markdown text.\nThey appear like this:\n\n**Your answer here. Replace the text in this markdown cell. Remember not to use Gen-AI here.**\n\nYou don't want to use Gen-AI in these cells for two reasons:\n\n- Thinking and reflecting is how you will get most of the benefit of doing this assignment.\n\n- It will produce meaningless and bland statements (that will be obviously meaningless and bland)\n  and you will get bad marks.\n  \n\n## Marking Criteria\n\nFor a code cell, any working correct answer will earn full marks. For\nnon-working code, or code that performs a different task, if it seems\nlike you were on the right track, the marker may issue partial marks.\n\nFor code cells that create visualisations, a correct answer is one that\ncreates a meaningful and useful visualisation of the data.\n\nFor a text (markdown) cell, word counts are only a guide: this is how\nmany words we think it will take to give a good answer. If you need to\nuse more words, or can express your answer in less words, go ahead: a\ngood answer will still receive full marks.\n\nAnswers given as dot points in a markdown cell are acceptable;\nlikewise full sentences in paragraphs are acceptable.\n\n## Resources\n\nThe textbook for the unit (_Introduction to Data Science_ by Igual and\nSegui) has some linear regression examples as well. You might find\nSection 6.2.3 useful if you are looking for sample code that performs\nlinear regression. Section 6.3.1 has an example of logistic\nregression.\n\n\n## Data\n\nYou will find a large zip file called `2025-S1-COMP2200-6200-assignment1.zip` on iLearn.  When you expand it\nout, you will see many files, including one that begins with your\nstudent number. e.g `1235345 Brown-Miller Group.csv`\n\nCopy it into the same directory as you copied this Jupyter notebook.\n\n### Create a GitHub repo within Github Classroom (0.1 marks)\n\n- Yes, we'll give you 0.1 marks just for getting this far.\n\n### Import any libraries you need (0.1 marks)\n\n",

For simpler trend analysis, the income is logarithmically transformed in the \"Base_10_Log_Revenue\" column. All five months have seen constant unfavourable media coverage, albeit in the absence of any scandals.

The main variables include months since launch, payroll, revenue, base 10log revenue, scandals, and media coverage. Each row represents a month in the company’s lifecycle, beginning from its launch. \nPayroll remains consistently high, indicating ongoing investment in human capital. Revenue starts relatively low but grows over time, reflecting increasing market traction. To better model this growth, a logarithmic transformation of revenue (base 10log revenue) was applied. This transformation helps stabilize variance and convert nonlinear relationships into linear ones, which improves the effectiveness of regression models.\nThe scandals column tracks whether the company has been involved in any public controversies. In the observed period, there are no recorded scandals, yet the media coverage remains consistently negative in the early months. This suggests that factors other than scandals—such as low early revenue, lack of visibility, or delayed success may be influencing negative press.\nLinear regression results show that actual revenue is the strongest predictor of company performance. Other features like months since launch and log revenue have minor effects, while scandals have no impact in the absence of events.\nlogistic regression model was used to predict the likelihood of negative media coverage. At 12 months, the probability stands at 42.95%, indicating a moderate risk of unfavorable press continuing despite improving financials.\nForecasting revenue 20 years into the future shows exponential growth, predicting values. While this suggests strong upward momentum, it is likely unrealistic due to real-world constraints like competition, market limits, and economic shifts.\nIn summary, the dataset highlights the disconnect that can exist between improving performance and public perception, underscoring the complexity of corporate reputation management alongside financial success.\n",
